# Local Whisper Setup

EchoDraft supports local speech-to-text processing using whisper.cpp. This keeps your audio completely private—nothing leaves your device.

## Quick Start

1. Open the **Control Panel** (right-click tray icon or click the overlay)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Speech to Text Processing**
3. Enable **Use Local Whisper**
4. Select a model (recommended: `base`)
5. Click **Save**

The first transcription will download the model automatically.

## Model Selection

| Model  | Size   | Speed    | Quality | RAM    | Best For              |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|--------|-----------------------|
| tiny   | 75MB   | Fastest  | Basic   | ~1GB   | Quick notes           |
| base   | 142MB  | Fast     | Good    | ~1GB   | **Recommended**       |
| small  | 466MB  | Medium   | Better  | ~2GB   | Professional use      |
| medium | 1.5GB  | Slow     | High    | ~5GB   | High accuracy         |
| large  | 3GB    | Slowest  | Best    | ~10GB  | Maximum quality       |

## How It Works

EchoDraft uses whisper.cpp, a high-performance C++ implementation of OpenAI's Whisper model:

1. whisper.cpp binary is bundled with the app (or uses system installation as fallback)
2. GGML models are downloaded on first use to `~/.cache/openwhispr/whisper-models/`
3. Audio is processed locally using FFmpeg (bundled with the app)

## Requirements

- **Disk Space**: 75MB–3GB depending on model
- **RAM**: 1GB–10GB depending on model
- **No additional dependencies required** - whisper.cpp is bundled in packaged builds

## Running From Source

If you're running EchoDraft locally from a git checkout (not a packaged app), download the whisper.cpp binary for your current platform:

```bash
npm run download:whisper-cpp
```

This puts the binary in `resources/bin/`. For multi-platform packaging from a single machine, use:

```bash
npm run download:whisper-cpp:all
```

## File Locations

| Data              | macOS                                        | Windows                              | Linux                           |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Models            | `~/.cache/openwhispr/whisper-models/`        | `%USERPROFILE%\.cache\openwhispr\whisper-models\` | `~/.cache/openwhispr/whisper-models/` |

## Troubleshooting

### "Not Found" Status
1. Click **Recheck Installation** in Control Panel
2. Restart the app
3. If bundled binary fails, install via package manager:
   - macOS: `brew install whisper-cpp`
   - Linux: Build from source at https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp

### Transcription Fails
1. Verify microphone permissions
2. Try a smaller model (tiny/base)
3. Check disk space for model downloads

### Slow Performance
1. Use smaller models (tiny or base)
2. Close resource-intensive apps
3. Consider using cloud mode for large files

## Privacy Comparison

| Mode  | Audio Leaves Device | Internet Required | Cost      |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Local | No                  | Only for model download | Free |
| Cloud | Yes (to OpenAI)     | Yes               | API usage |
